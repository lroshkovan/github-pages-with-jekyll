# My Life
I am currently a senior at East Brunswick High School and I am planning to go to college at University of California - Santa Barbara! I am currently planning to major in biology and hoping to go to medical school. I have a sister who recently graduated from Rutgers University. I was born in Israel but shortly moved to New Jersey! In my free time I enjoy playing tennis and painting.

- During my senior year I was vice president of Science Honors Society and helped manage the social media and social outreach.
