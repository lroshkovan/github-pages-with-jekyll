My life:

I am currently a senior at East Brunswick High School and I am going to University of California - Santa Barbara next year
and I plan to major in biology. I also have a sister who just recently graduated from Rutgers University. I was born in 
Israel but I shortly moved to New Jersey when I was young. I am now 18 years old and I like playing tennis and painting
in my free time.

Fun facts:
I am currently Vice President of Science Honors Society and I am involved in social outreach.
I work at East Brunswick Chinese as a cashier and I have worked as a camp counselor at Lakeview for several years.
I enjoy volunteering and I am involved with East Brunswick Youth Council as both a member and an excutive board member.
